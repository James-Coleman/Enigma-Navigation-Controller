# Enigma-Navigation-Controller
The Enigma with a UI!

I have been learning Swift since early July and this is the first fully formed app I have made.
The backend working took several days to reproduce the working of the Enigma machine.
Specifically, this program emulates the German army, air force, and early naval Enigma, also known as the "M3".
Creating the UI took about a day, with another day and a half to test and bug fix.
